            h1 Practical learning to fuel innovation.
            h4 Working with conventional teaching practices causes an influx of theoretical learning, where students don't understand the real life applications of their work.
            p At codeCertain our emphasis is on teaching the practical implications of programming to our users. Over the years, programming has become an essential skill to have. From scripting languages like JavaScript to data analysis with languages like Python & R, the impact that basic skills can have upon individuals is becoming more prominent.
            p The largest problem with conventional learning methods is that they don't allow for the development of real world skills. It's like knowing how a bicycle works, but not actually ever having ridden one. We offer practical learning by allowing our users to build applications similar to the ones they use on a day-to-day basis, and help them build their portfolios by connecting them to volunteer organisations.
