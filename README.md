# codeCertain
codeCertain is a currently under development project focused around building an open source platform for practical programming education. It's main objectives are to be an easily accessible platform for users to learn about various community contributed programming topics. 

## Synopsis & Inspiration
codeCertain was built out of need. A large majority of current programming tutor websites focus around incentivizing education through short tidbits of learning, where the end user feels instant gratification upon completing a small learning goal. Additionlly, unlike intuitive platforms like Duolingo (for language education), current programming platforms don't emphasize on pratical applications and memorization of syntax. Once a topic is completed, it is generally forgotten about and never comes up again in future syllabus. 

codeCertain is developed following the Duolingo principles which tremendously focuses upon the constant relearning of skills to promote memorization of syntax amongst users. It also aims to connect with volunteer agencies who are in need of development skills, to connect prospect users looking to develop their portfolios. 

## Compilation
The current front-end of the site is written in Pug/Sass but the compiled files will also be present. The back-end and JS is currently in development and will be added as development progresses.

## Next steps
The current next steps for the platform are to develop the Ruby on Rails back-end and include integration to the front-end by using JS. The estimated completion of the project is sometime near Christmas 2017.
